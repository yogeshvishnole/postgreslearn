First in command line go to the path of postgres database upto the bin directory.

then run the following command

example: pg_restore -U postgres -d dvdrental  C:\temp\dvdrental.tar

so command is --

pg_restore -U user_name -d db_name path_of_.tar_file_of_database

we can restore the same by pg_admin gui as well
but if error occurs go to prferences and set the binary path 
as path of bin directory of postgres dbms.
